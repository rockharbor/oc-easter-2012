			<h1>Why We Celebrate</h1>
		</header>
		<p>The story of Easter was set in motion in a garden thousands of years ago with a man named Adam and a woman named Eve. Adam and Eve walked with God. They were complete in His presence. They had life and they had it to the full. It was how God intended it.</p>
		<p>But the man and woman were deceived. They rebelled against God and, in an instant, were banished from the garden. The fullness of God&apos;s presence was gone as was the promise of life that would sustain forever.</p>
		<p>In that same instant, God, in His great love, initiated a plan to redeem the world and to free the people He created. He promised a Savior that would one day come and reclaim what was His.</p>
		<p>Generations later, Jesus invaded the world. From His birth in a simple manger…to His teachings that He was the only way to God…to His life that offered an entirely new way of looking at the world, Jesus was a revolutionary. He was a threat to the established order of things.</p>
		<p>Eventually, He was killed for being that threat. He was nailed to a cross and crucified as the redeeming sacrifice for all of humanity. But three days later, He rose from the dead…restoring the path to God and to life.</p>
		<p>Through Jesus, we can have once again have freedom and life as God intended it.</p>
		<p class="orange">That&apos;s why we celebrate.</p>
